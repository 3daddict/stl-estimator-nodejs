### How to work on this project
1. Make a [fork](https://github.com/3daddict/stl-estimator-nodejs/fork) of this Repo
2. Request to be assigned in the Issue. **DO NOT** work on an issue if you are not assigned. It will not be reviewed or merged. This gives the assigned person the time they need to complete the feature.
3. Once assigned to the issue create a feature branch. For example `git checkout -b new-feature-name`
4. Once your code is tested and ready create a **pull request** and ALWAYS to **dev** branch.

### Working with the code base
This has been started with a simple NodeJS Express server and Handlebars.js templating. Please keep your JS to Vanilla Javascript. Do not add jQuery and if you would like to add a library please request it in the comments of the issue you are working in.

### Requesting Features
If there is a feature or improvement you would to have added to this project create an [ISSUE](https://github.com/3daddict/stl-estimator-nodejs/issues) for review.

### Code Review and Deployments
I'll try to review code in the evenings as time is availbile to answer questions, assign users, test code and deploy to production. Please be patient as life can be crazy sometimes with work and family.
